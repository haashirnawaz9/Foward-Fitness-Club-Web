            <h3>Food for Thought</h3>
            <img src="images/food-thought.jpg" alt="food for thought image" class="round">
            <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking 
                about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank 
                with the right type of fuel
            </p>
            <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make 
                a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.
            </p>
            <p>Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your activity levels and calories.</p>

            <p>Control your implusive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.</p>

            <h3>What to Eat</h3>
            <img src="images/fresh-food.jpg"
            `alt="fresh vegetables, fruit, eggs, and nuts" class="round">
            <p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean read meat</li>
                <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
                <li>Fruits</li>
                <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Limit the consumption of bread, paste, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in carbohydrates.</p>
            <p>When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.</p>
